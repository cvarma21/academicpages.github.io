Education
======
* B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, 2019 (expected)


Research and Work experience
======

* Summer 2018: Summer Research Intern, IIT Kharagpur
* Research Area : Artificial Intelligence, Formal Methods and Verification
  * Worked on a rule based system for a health care application under the guidance of Professor and Head of Computer and Informatics Center, IIT Kharagpur, Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay under the summer fellowship program sponsored by Microsoft Research India.
  * Designed and implemented the various functionalities of the rule based system : add/delete: parameters, conditions, clauses, predicates, rules for the rule-based system.
  * Integrated the state of the art Microsoft Z3 theorem prover with the rule-based system to check for the consistency of rules in the system using the SMT-LIB 2.0 Standard.

* Summer 2017: Summer Research Intern, IIT Bombay
* Research Area : Machine Learning
  * Worked under the guidance of Full Professor and Head of CFDVS, Prof. G. Sivakumar of the Computer Science Department at the Centre for Formal Design and Verification of Software(CFDVS), IIT Bombay on a project titled Simulations for Logic.
  * Project involved building a interactive teaching tool for learning and exploring Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) using any web browser as client. The application could also adjust variable ordering of the BDD as per the requirement
of the learner.
  * Built the application in Python and used a micro web framework in Python - Flask, for the back-end development of the web application. Used the application to test optimal variable orderings for BDDs.
  * Research Publication - An Enhanced Algorithm for Variable Reordering in Binary Decision Diagrams
  * Github: https://github.com/cvarma21/AI-HTML5.
  
* Jan 2017-Feb 2017 : Marketing Intern, Indian Institute of Management Lucknow
  * Worked under the guidance of Prof. Sameer Mathur, IIM Lucknow on an academic internship.
  * Learnt how to craft better campaigns, programs, and customer experiences that effectively leverage software and data.
  * Created an original marketing plan for a novel Android application - ’i.heart.cabs’ to be released on the Google Play
Store.
  
* Summer 2016: Project Trainee, Data Analytics, ITC Infotech
  * Identified and analyzed key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed (DND) products of ITC Foods and Personal Care Product categories using a weighted score methodology.
  * Visited wholesale distributors in the south Kolkata region to understand the issues responsible for DND.
  * Collaborated the trends which emerged from the data with the findings from the wholesale distributor visits to provide a strategic actionable with recommendations to reduce DND.
