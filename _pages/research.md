of the learner.
  * Built the application in Python and used a micro web framework in Python - Flask, for the back-end development of the web application. Used the application to test optimal variable orderings for BDDs.
  * Research Publication - An Enhanced Algorithm for Variable Reordering in Binary Decision Diagrams
  * Github: https://github.com/cvarma21/AI-HTML5.
  
* **Jan-Feb 2017: Marketing Intern, Indian Institute of Management Lucknow**

  * Worked under the guidance of Prof. Sameer Mathur, IIM Lucknow on an academic internship.
