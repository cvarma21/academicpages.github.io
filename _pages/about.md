Hello, I'm Chaitanya Varma. I am a final year graduate student at the CICS, University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computer Science with a Data Science concentration. 

My goal is to work towards building a great product that provides value to the user while bringing about a positive impact on the planet.

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from several past internships. During the summer of 2020, I worked remotely as a software engineering intern at DocuSign where I worked with an amazing team to design and build a URL Shortener. Prior to joining the graduate program at CICS UMass Amherst, I spent six months (spring and summer 2019) as a software engineering intern at IBM in Bengaluru where I was a part of the team developing business critical applications leveraging Analytics. I've worked at IIT Kharagpur (summer 2018) on an AI rule-based application for a healthcare application and IIT Bombay (summer 2017) on building a teaching tool to visualize binary decision diagrams. And at ITC Infotech (summer 2016), in Data Science, where I analyzed the key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed (DND) products of ITC Foods & Personal Care Product categories.

Whenever I get the time, I enjoy reading, working out, and learning the guitar.

If you think I might be a good fit for a certain role you have in mind or just want to discuss about anything else that's of mutual interest, please reach out to me at cvarma@cs.umass.edu.

Areas of interest: Software Engineering, Data Science.

Carpe Diem.
