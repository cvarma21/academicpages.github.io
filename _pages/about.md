Hello, I'm Chaitanya Varma. I am a first year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computer Science with a Data Science concentration. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and data science. 

I am a highly motivated and hardworking student who is interested in continuous lifelong learning. I am passionate about applying AI solutions to help improve people’s lives on a large scale. 

Currently, I am working as a software developer at IBM India and I'm a part of the team developing business critical applications using latest Agile practises leveraging Analytics.

I’ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from several past internships. Recently, I worked at IIT Kharagpur on an AI rule-based application for a healthcare application. I have also worked at IIT Bombay on building a teaching tool for binary decision diagrams, and at ITC Infotech, in Data Science, where I analyzed the key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed (DND) products of ITC Foods and Personal Care Product categories.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, working out, teaching occasionally, and playing the guitar.

I'm always looking for opportunities where I can contribute to building a great product that provides value to the end user. If you think I might be a good fit for a certain role you have in mind, please reach out to me at cvarma@umass.edu. 

Carpe Diem.
