Hello, I'm Chaitanya Varma. I am a first year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in Computer Science with a Data Science concentration. 

I am a highly motivated student who is interested in continuous lifelong learning.

Before joining the MS program at UMass Amherst, I was working as a software developer intern at IBM India where I was a part of the team developing business critical applications leveraging Analytics.

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from several past internships. I have worked at IIT Kharagpur on an AI rule-based application for a healthcare application. I have also worked at IIT Bombay on building a teaching tool to visualize binary decision diagrams. And at ITC Infotech, in Data Science, where I analyzed the key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed (DND) products of ITC Foods and Personal Care Product categories.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, working out, and playing the guitar.

If you think I might be a good fit for a certain role you have in mind, please reach out to me at cvarma@cs.umass.edu.

Carpe Diem.
