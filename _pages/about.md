Hello, I'm Chaitanya Varma. I am a final year undergraduate student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Intelligent Systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer vision. 

I am a highly motivated and hardworking student who is interested in continuous lifelong learning. I am passionate about applying AI solutions to help improve people’s lives on a large scale. I’m particularly interested in the application of computer vision to solve some of the challenges that people face on a daily basis.

I’ve had the opportunity to learn from several past internships. Recently, I worked at IIT Kharagpur on an AI rule-based application for a healthcare application. I have also worked at IIT Bombay on building a teaching tool for binary decision diagrams and propositional logic, and at ITC Infotech where I analyzed the key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed (DND) products of ITC Foods and Personal Care Product categories using a weighted score methodology.

In my free time, I like reading, working out, teaching occasionally, playing the guitar - although not all at the same time. 

Carpe diem.
