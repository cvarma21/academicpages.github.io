Hello, I'm Chaitanya Varma and I'm a software engineer by profession.

I've graduated from the master's program in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I’ve been fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from several past internships in diverse fields. During the summer of 2020, I worked remotely as a software engineering intern at DocuSign where I worked with an amazing team to design and build a URL shortener. Prior to joining the graduate program at UMass Amherst, I spent six months (spring and summer 2019) as a software engineering intern at IBM where I was a part of the team developing business critical applications leveraging analytics. I’ve worked at IIT Kharagpur (summer 2018) on an AI rule-based health-care application and at IIT Bombay (summer 2017) to build a teaching tool to visualize binary decision diagrams. My first internship was at ITC Infotech (summer 2016), in data analytics, where I analyzed the key factors and trends leading to damaged and destroyed products of ITC Foods & Personal Care Product categories.

Whenever I get the time, I enjoy reading, hiking and guitar.
